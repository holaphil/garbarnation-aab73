**GarBar Nation** is an American garage bar “GarBar’ innovation team headquartered in Maplewood, New Jersey. Working in partnership with Emmy Award winning producer and former SVP of Unscripted Original Programming at AMC, Mary Conlon, GarBar Nation is building a collection of original curated content spotlighting Garbars across the nation.

The group consists of GarBar creator and influencer **John Garbarino**, along with his fellow GarBar Guys and owners: **Brian “Smitty” Krupkin**, **Joey Melvin** and **Phil “DIY” DiGiulio**. These four GarBar creators were made infamous by their incredible garage transformations as seen across various media outlets including the NY Post, CBS and NY1 to name a few. The NY Post’s five minute GarBar mini-documentary alone has exceeded over one million views on YouTube! This documentary, along with many other local and major media TV spots, have positioned Maplewood, NJ as an epicenter for the burgeoning Garbar scene.

**Launching later in Fall 2021**, GarBar Nation expands to begin shining a spotlight on GarBars across the USA. GarBar Nation will feature interviews, video tours, and various DIY content designed to help assist others while transforming their underutilized garages into something far more useful, a GarBar!
