Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Negat esse eam, inquit, propter se expetendam. Nam de isto magna dissensio est. Nullum inveniri verbum potest quod magis idem declaret Latine, quod Graece, quam declarat voluptas. Idemne potest esse dies saepius, qui semel fuit? Non est ista, inquam, Piso, magna dissensio. Ita multo sanguine profuso in laetitia et in victoria est mortuus. Quasi vero, inquit, perpetua oratio rhetorum solum, non etiam philosophorum sit. Duo Reges: constructio interrete.

Quae diligentissime contra Aristonem dicuntur a Chryippo. Videamus igitur sententias eorum, tum ad verba redeamus. Levatio igitur vitiorum magna fit in iis, qui habent ad virtutem progressionis aliquantum. Virtutis, magnitudinis animi, patientiae, fortitudinis fomentis dolor mitigari solet. Nihil enim hoc differt. Quorum sine causa fieri nihil putandum est.

## Sed Nimis Multa

Intro yourself and the name of your garage bar
I'm Joe Melvin, owner of Sloppy Joe's dive bar. 

**What / Who inspired you? **
Mulligan's and DC's bars in Hoboken. After moving to Maplewood I wanted my own dive bar I could share with friends and family. 

How long did it take to build your GarBar?
It's still a work in progress, but the original build only took 2 weekends. 

What was the reason for building your garage bar?
I just wanted somewhere to hang out that felt different than being in the house. It's only 30 feet away, but it's nice to be able to step away from the chaos that occurs in the house. 

What’s your design aesthetic?
I don't really have one. I just put in things I like. 

What materials did you use?
Just things from the hardware store or things that weren't being used elsewhere in the house. 

Where did you store all the junk from the garage?
On the other side of the garage!

What do you use your Garage Bar for?
Add response here

What did it cost you?
I only have about $750 bucks in it. The most expensive thing was the fridge. A lot of the stuff is recycled from other locations or donated. 

What was most challenging?
The heating/cooling. It's too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. It's basic electrics, no insulation and exposed to rain and snow. But if it was too comfortable out there I'd never come back in!

How has it changed your life?
I'm able to socialize as much as I want. People love to come over, we're not all stuck inside and you really do feel like you're in a bar. 

What’s your specialty drink?
I'm not much of a cocktail maker. I can pour whiskey over ice and open both cans and bottles for you. I don't have running water at Sloppys, so the less glasses to wash up, the better.
