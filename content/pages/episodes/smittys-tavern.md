Smitty's Tavern is a great example of working with what you might not know you already have. After cleaning out the junk and a little power washing, the beauty of the original walls is what really makes this garage bar (GarBar) stand out. It's authentic, rustic, with a kind of ski chalet vibe...  the perfect location for a beer or two.
