More than six months into the pandemic, Steve Rosenthal and his family decided it was finally time to transform one side of their two car garage into something more useful, a GarBar. Fortunately for Steve, his close friend and neighbor (Tom) was there to guide him along the way. PS â€“ In case you hadn't noticed, Steve's a huge Mets fan. We won't hold it against him!
