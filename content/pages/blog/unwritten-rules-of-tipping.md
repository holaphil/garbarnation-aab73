If you answered yes to either of those, then owning a garage bar might not be for you!\n\n\_Garage bars are personal spaces that are usually built to hang out with friends and family, not as a way to make money. If you want to make money (rather than spend it on anything from neon signs to kegerators), then maybe buy or invest in a bar or a business. To be completely upfront and honest here, a garage bar is a sure fire way to lose money… well, it’s not lost, it’s spent on entertaining and hanging out.\n"

      ### But back to tipping…


      Your garage bar isn’t a business, it’s not a venue that’s licensed to sell
      alcohol. It’s part of your house, and in the same way that you’d hope a
      guest would bring a bottle of wine or a 6-pack over for dinner, you should
      expect a guest to the bar will bring something with them. If you’re going
      to a garage bar, the same applies. Take that new IPA that you’ll never
      find again, but is really good. Invest in a bottle of tequila that you
      really liked when you were last on vacation, or just grab a case of beer
      next time you’re at the liquor store. It’s a conversation starter if
      nothing else. I mean who else is going to care about the IPA you bought
      over? The one that’s quadruple-filtered, with burnt tree oak and
      elderberry aromas and mixed with dry wheat chaff !


      It’s a form of payment, but also a right of passage.


      Bring nothing once and you may get a pass, bring nothing twice and you
      won’t get invited back.


      The owner of a garage bar isn’t here to feed your drinking habit. They are
      there to hang out, enjoy your company and not to think about if you’re
      going to drink everything in the place. 


      Tip with excess alcohol, especially as no-one carries cash anymore, and
      asking to pay or tip just makes things awkward. If you drink a bottle of
      wine on average, bring 2. If you drink 4 of a 6-pack, leave 2. It’s also a
      way to tip the bartender with some supplies for the bar. And again, it’s a
      conversation starter. The next guest may ask who hated you so much to
      leave that shitty IPA, or you can play the guessing game as to which
      ‘friend’ left you a solitary Coors Light!
