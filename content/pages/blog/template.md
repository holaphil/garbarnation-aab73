      Maybe a kegerator is for you, maybe it’s not – it can depend on how keen
      you are to drink the same beer for a week or more (depending on the size
      of the keg and how many/few friends you have!). Having a beer/wine fridge
      is not really an option, it’s a necessity for any garage bar. If you think
      a beer fridge is merely a mini-fridge, think again—there are fridges that
      lock (great to keep the kids out) and fridges that chill to specific
      temperatures that can adjust to match the beer inside. There are large
      ones, small ones, tall ones, glass-door ones, doubles, triples and pretty
      much any color or design you can imagine.
