      **Maybe a kegerator is for you, maybe it’s not** – it can depend on how
      keen you are to drink the same beer for a week or more (depending on the
      size of the keg and how many/few friends you have!). Having a beer/wine
      fridge is not really an option, it’s a necessity for any garage bar. If
      you think a beer fridge is merely a mini-fridge, think again—there are
      fridges that lock (great to keep the kids out) and fridges that chill to
      specific temperatures that can adjust to match the beer inside. There are
      large ones, small ones, tall ones, glass-door ones, doubles, triples and
      pretty much any color or design you can imagine.


      **Here are a few things to consider…**


      #### Size


      It all depends on what you’re looking for and what space you have to work
      with. One rule of thumb when considering size is to think of what beers
      you like. If you prefer cans, opt for a shelving situation designed for
      storing your beers. Keep in mind that some craft beers, hard seltzers and
      mixers come in different sized cans/bottles, so it’s helpful if the layout
      inside the fridge is adjustable. If you’re a wine drinker, make sure the
      fridge comes with removable shelves, or has a separate section for wine
      bottles.


      #### Look


      Having a glass door on the fridge is great to show people what you have in
      your bar. It usually ups the price a little, but will give your space more
      of a bar feel.


      #### Reversible Doors


      Details matter, so make sure a single-door beverage cooler has a
      reversible door to install the handle on either the left or right side.
      This will allow you to save space and make sure your unit functions
      exactly as it should within your space.


      #### Noise


      You will want a fridge that won’t disrupt your conversations or interfere
      with the game on the  TV. The more industrial, larger fridges make more
      noise, and are probably unnecessary unless you have a huge space.


      #### Temperature


      When it comes to proper storage and taste preservation, temperature plays
      a key role in protecting your collection. Think about what you drink most
      – the recommended serving temperature for stouts is 50 to 55 degrees, pale
      ales at 45 to 55 degrees, and lagers at between 40 to 45 – so it does
      matter. Some beverage fridges come with dual temperature zones to make it
      even easier to properly house your entire line of beverages – a good
      choice to keep your regulars happy.
